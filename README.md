## Meeting Day 0

### Group overview
*Key strength*
- Phil: proper git flow, JS
- Kirk: okay at JS, NOT a fan of HTML and CSS
- Nate: CSS, not design
- Miranda: CSS

*Implementation*
- it's a pretty even half-and-half division of JS and CSS, and we all contribute, with half of the people focus on JS, and the other half design

*Professional Competancies*
- Phil: Craft competancies
- Kirk: craft competancies, to make code to be more efficient and better-looking
- Nate: better project planning
- Miranda: communication, being better at communicating my ideas

*Cooperation plan*
- daily meeting of what we are currently working on, what's the progress, and who's behind schedule
- merge code in the morning meeting time if confilict arises

### Conflict Resolution

*Conflict Resolution Plan*
- try to understand the conflict first, group vote on issues
- if 50/50, keep voting until there is a majority
 
- if one person takes over, we will remind the person for the responsibilities. And the person have to buy the rest of the group coffee
- Since we know we all will give our best-effort, if it appears that one is not contributing, the team can tell that the person is struggling. For the struggle, we will implement the 15-min rule. If the task is exceptionally challenging, the group will all try to contribute

- If a person notice there's another member is contributing, the person should talk to group member B see if the person agrees. Also given we are all motivated in the group, we will offer help and have a meeting to ask for the cause of why is not contributing. 
- The conflict will be escalated we will either vote, or find out the cause. If no progress by end of day, the issue will be brought up to the instructor

### Communication

- 9-7, if post class hours, give till next dayflic
- on Slack, slack group, discord, main communcation would be in-person, outside of class we will use text. Discord will be used to screenshare
- If falling behind, ask for help, implement the 15-min rule
- Every hour
- Everyone will share in the meeting, we will have daily readout
- Don't shoot down ideas right away, group voting, give every idea a fair chance

### Work Plan

- We will come up with an overview plan, with the required components, and we will have fluff. We each first pick what we want to pick, if conflict arises, we vote on the issue
- Meistertask

### Git Process

- Everything
- Organization
- main --> dev(shared) --> individual(feature name). Do not start a new feature until the task if  We merge from invidual to dev if working propertly invidually, and pull from dev every time when a new branch is created
- 2 people will approve, and Phil will be the primary person to do the PR, and we rotate daily 
- No after-hour merge
